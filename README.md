# GPU-vs-CPU-speed-test

# Testing the computation speed of GPU and CPU for both Pytorch and Tensorflow

The instruction are included in the code as comments.
In order for libraries to detect your GPU, you must have installed cuda toolkit and CUDNN.

#### my run time test results on NVIDIA Geforce Mx110 (GPU) and intel core i7  8th Gen (cpu):
## Pytorch: 
GPU = 1.57s 
CPU = 28.86s

## Tensorflow: 
GPU = 3.27s
CPU = 40.65s
